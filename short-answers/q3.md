# Question
What is wrong with this code?

```js
const printDouble = (num) => console.log(num * 2);
const nums = [1,2,3];
nums.forEach(printDouble());
```

# Answer
The problem with this code is that the function `printDouble` is not being passed by reference into the `forEach` higher order function. With the (), it seems like you are trying to invoke the function right away rather than referencing and executing the function at each new element in the nums array.
