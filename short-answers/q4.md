# Question
What is an "inline function"? Give an example with your definition.

# Answer
An "inline function" is a function that is defined within the parameters of another function unliked a function that is defined prior to calling it. For example, to divide an array of numbers by 2, using an "inline function" as the callback we can do: 
`const hof = (arr, (num) => num/2)`
The second argument is the "inline function".
